Dockerfile works correctly, as can be seen in the images below.

First, container is running:

[<img alt="Ridge Regression Performance" width="700" height=400 src="./images/Container ID.JPG" />]()

Second, the log of the container, states we're running on the appropriate HOST, and PORT:

[<img alt="Ridge Regression Performance" width="700" height=400 src="./images/Container Running.JPG" />]()

And finally, as we can see via the appropriate address in our browser, the correct message is presented to us (Hello World):

[<img alt="Ridge Regression Performance" width="700" height=400 src="./images/Port Working.JPG" />]()
